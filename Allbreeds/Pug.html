            <h2> Pug </h2>
            <h3> Type : Family dog </h3>
            <p> he Pug is often described as a lot of dog in a small space.
                 These sturdy, compact dogs are a part of the American 
                 Kennel Club’s Toy group, and are known as the clowns of 
                 the canine world because they have a great sense of
                  humor and like to show off.
</p>
    
<p>              Originally bred to be lap dogs, Pugs thrive on human 
    companionship. They’re highly sensitive, and though they can make 
    for great apartment pets, they will not appreciate being left home 
    alone for long hours of the day. Although these pups have a stubborn 
    side, especially when it comes to house training, they’re playful,
     affectionate dogs who will get along well even with novice pet parents.
      If you’re looking for a loving, easygoing pal, this may be the breed for you!
