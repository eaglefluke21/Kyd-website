            <h2> Borzoi </h2>
            <h3> Type : Hound dog </h3>
            <p>  The Borzoi dog breed was developed in Russia as a coursing and hunting dog. These hounds hunted in teams of three to go after rabbit, foxes, and wolves. They later became popular as a companion for royalty across continental Europe.
</p>

<p>Borzois are laid-back family dogs who can even adapt to apartment living, despite their large size. They do not, however, fair well when left alone for long periods of time during the day. This sensitive breed needs companionship. Their beautiful coat also sheds a lot and requires some maintenance on your part.
