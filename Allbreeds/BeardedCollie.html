            <h2> Bearded Collie </h2>
            <h3> Type : Herding dog </h3>
            <p> The Bearded Collie dog breed was developed in Scotland to herd sheep and cattle in any weather or terrain. They function today as excellent family companions, show dogs, working sheepdogs, or even all three.
</p>

<p>Because of their energy and quickness Bearded Collies are well suited to competing in obedience, rally, agility, and other dog sports. Theyâ€™re highly affectionate and can even make good pets for novice dog parents. They do, however, need a good amount of exercise and would prefer a fenced-in yard to run around in.</p>
