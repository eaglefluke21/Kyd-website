            <h2> Border Collie </h2>
            <h3> Type : Herding dog </h3>
            <p> The Border Collie dog breed was developed to gather and control sheep in the hilly border country between Scotland and England. They’re known for their intense stare, or “eye,” with which they control their flock. They’re dogs with unlimited energy, stamina, and working drive, all of which make them a premier herding dog; Border Collies are still used today to herd sheep on farms and ranches around the world
</p>

<p>The highly trainable and intelligent, Border Collies also excel in various canine sports, including obedience, flyball, agility, tracking, and flying disc competitions. They can make for great family companions, so long as they get a lot — a lot! — of physical and mental exercise.
