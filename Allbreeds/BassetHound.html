            <h2> Basset Hound </h2>
            <h3> Type : Hound dog </h3>
            <p>  The Basset Hound dog breed was bred for hunting small game such as rabbits and is still used for this purpose in some parts of the United States. When they’re not on the trail of a bunny, they’re laid-back family friends who love kids.
</p>

<p>You will need to commit to at least moderate exercise and feed your pup an appropriate diet, as their easygoing demeanor could lead to weight gain and the health issues that can come with. If you can keep your Basset active, in spite of how much they may protest, you’ll have a loving companion who will stick around for many years to come.
