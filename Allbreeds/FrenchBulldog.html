            <h2> French Bulldog </h2>
            <h3> Type : Family dog </h3>
            <p>  The French Bulldog has enjoyed a long history as a
                 companion dog. Created in England to be a miniature 
                 Bulldog, they accompanied English lacemakers to France
                 , where they acquired their “Frenchie” moniker.
</p>

             <p>Besides being companions, they once served as excellent
                  ratters, but today their job focuses on being fabulous 
                  family friends and show dogs. Even apartment dwellers
                   and first-time pet parents will love this affectionate
                    breed.
                    It’s important to remember that dogs of any breed can 
                    suffer from health issues throughout their lives.
                     A good pet insurance plan can help you prepare to
                      give your dog the care they need at any age.
