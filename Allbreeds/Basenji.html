            <h2> Basenji</h2>
            <h3> Type : Hunting dog /Herding dog </h3>
            <p>  Out of Africa, the Basenji dog breed was originally found in the Congo. These dogs use both scent and sight to hunt and were originally used to flush small game into hunters’ nets and to control village rodent populations. These days, they also make for great, loving, furry family members.
</p>

<p>Clever and endearing, these dogs are good companions for the person or family who can stay a step ahead of them. They can adapt to apartment living, and even novice pet parents will find these pups to be great first-timer dogs. Just make sure you can provide enough exercise to meet their high energy levels. You’ll need to commit to plenty of walks and playtime.
