            <h2> English Setter </h2>
            <h3> Type : Hunting dog </h3>
            <p> The English Setter dog breed was named for
                 these dogs’ practice of “setting,” or
                  crouching low, when they found birds so
                   hunters could throw their nets over them.
                    After the development of the gun, breeders
                     developed the dog so they would stand in 
                     the more traditional Pointer style.
</p>

<p>English Setters are still used as a hunting dogs today,
     as well as family companions. This super affectionate 
     dog loves their human family and even other pets in the
      home, but apartment dwellers beware! These pups have
       high energy and exercise needs, so they will prefer
        a home with a yard and space to run.</p>
