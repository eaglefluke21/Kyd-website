            <h2> Australian Cattle Dog </h2>
            <h3> Type : Herd dog </h3>
            <p> The Australian Cattle Dog is an extremely intelligent, active, and sturdy dog breed. Developed by Australian settlers to handle herds of cattle on expansive ranches, they’re still used today as a herding dog. They thrive on having a job to do and on being part of all family activities.
</p>

<p>Australian Cattle Dogs are loyal and protective of their families, though wary of outsiders. Besides herding work, they do well at canine sports, including agility, obedience, rally, flyball, and flying disc competitions. Novice pet parents and apartment dwellers beware; these dogs need a lot — a lot! — of mental and physical activity to stay happy and healthy, and to prevent bored, destructive behavior.
